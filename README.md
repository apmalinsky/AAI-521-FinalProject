# Panoptic Segmentation with Panoptic FPN

This repository implements a Panoptic Feature Pyramid Network (Panoptic FPN) for panoptic segmentation on the COCO dataset. The project combines instance and semantic segmentation tasks to achieve comprehensive scene understanding.

# Introduction
Panoptic segmentation is the task of assigning every pixel in an image to either an instance of an object or a "stuff" category, such as sky or road. This project utilizes the Panoptic FPN architecture with a ResNet-50 backbone to tackle the COCO dataset.

# Features
- Panoptic FPN architecture: Combines instance and semantic segmentation for end-to-end panoptic segmentation.
- ResNet-50 backbone: Robust feature extraction for improved model accuracy.
- Dual segmentation heads: Instance segmentation and semantic segmentation heads enable holistic scene understanding.
- COCO Dataset Support: Comprehensive evaluation on one of the most challenging datasets.

# Setup
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/panoptic-segmentation.git
cd panoptic-segmentation
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the COCO dataset: Visit the COCO Dataset and download the train and validation sets. Update the dataset path in the configuration file (config.yaml).
4. Configure the project: Modify parameters such as batch size, learning rate, and epochs in the config.yaml file.

# Usage
1. Train the Model: python train.py
2. Evaluate the Model: python evaluate.py
3. Inference: Run the inference script to visualize panoptic segmentation results on new images: python inference.py --image-path path/to/image.jpg

# Results
Quantitative and qualitative results will be updated here, showcasing model performance on the COCO dataset.

# Challenges and Solutions
- Handling overlapping tasks: Used task-specific loss functions to balance instance and semantic segmentation.
- Data processing bottlenecks: Optimized data pipeline with multi-threading to improve training throughput.
- Model convergence: Applied a tailored learning rate schedule to prevent overfitting and enhance stability.

# Model Architecture
The Panoptic FPN architecture uses a ResNet-50 backbone for feature extraction, followed by an FPN module to handle multi-scale inputs. It features two specialized heads: one for ROI-based instance segmentation and another for dense semantic segmentation. This dual-head design allows for effective pixel-level and instance-level segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation performance on COCO.
